# <password-generator>

## Description

Randomly generated passwords will help with security needs for online accounts. I created this password generator in order to help progress my JavaScript skills. This project will help people randomly generate a password independently from bigger websites. Working on this project helped me learn arrays, objects, and methods on JavaScript.
